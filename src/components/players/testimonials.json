    "testimonial": "Kadri is an elite offensive talent. He has great hands and can make a tape to tape pass with ease. He is a good skater who uses his agility and acceleration well. When Kadri is on his game he can take over the ice. However, he tends to have trouble with consistency and has been accused of playing when he wants too. Kadri can be physical at times, but is not known for that type of game. Needs work in the defensive zone. (Tyler Parchem, EP, 2013)"

    "testimonial": "A big, strong, physical and mean stay-at-home defenseman. There is nothing fancy about Nemeth's offensive game and there are players out there with far better hockey sense and passing ability (although Nemeth's first pass is pretty good), but he is a very valuable player with his determined and tight defensive play. Has good timing in his hits and is quite mobile considering his large frame. - Elite Prospects, 2012"

    "testimonial": "A superstar in the making since an early age, MacKinnon provides a very complete combination of speed and skill. He is an amazing skater with fantastic puckhandling and hockey sense. MacKinnon has the ability to make quick plays and score flashy goals, but isn't shy about battling for the puck in front of the net either. He is surprisingly physical and owns a great shot to go along with quick hands. (Matias Strozyk, 2012)"

    "testimonial": "An exceptionally talented playmaker and always a consistent threat on the ice; Rantanen is a combination of elite-level hockey sense, silky smooth hands, and nimble skating. Needs to improve his shot and physical play, as he doesn't take advantage of his size in many situations. All-in-all, an intelligent, big-bodied forward that oozes skill. (Curtis Joe, EP 2014)"

Skates with exceptional exuberance and fluidity. Accurate release on his shot and a good eye for open passing lanes. Proactive defensively and puts the pressure on the opposition. Needs to have a more active stick and a more felt presence in shooting lanes, but he has shown a willingness to learn, and these skills will develop. All-in-all, an exciting offensive defenceman who displays noteworthy offensive and defensive instincts. (Curtis Joe, EP 2015)"

He reads and executes plays quickly, making good things happen for his teammates every time he is out on the ice. Stickhandling and puck possession play is superb. Makes high percentage decisions that help his team move the puck up-ice. High-end hockey IQ and understands his own game very well, allowing him to stay coachable and play to his strengths in any situation. Makar's potential is that of a traditional franchise defender that can do it all. [EP 2017]"
